   d. null
   e. undefined

4. Datatype is classification defines the type of value a variable is holding.

16. functions : These are the callable objects in JavaScript
17. Date : Represents dates and times.
18. RegExp : Represents the regular expression for pattern matching.
19. set : a collection of unique values
20. map : a collection of key-value pair where keys can be of any type.
