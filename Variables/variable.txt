---------------VARIABLES-----------------
1. Variables are named container used for storing data values.

1. VAR :
2. var is a function scoped 
3. var can be redeclared and reinitialized within the same block
4. it is hoisted and if we try to access before initialization we get undefined

5.LET :
6. let is a block scoped
7. let cannot be re declared within the same block
8. it is not hoisted and if we try to access it we get reference error or TEZ(temporal dead zone)

9.CONST :
10. const is also a block scoped and is a constant
11. values cannot be redeclared and reinitialized and must be initialized at the time  of declaration
12. once the values are assigned we connot change it for primary data types
13. assigned values can be modified for non-primitive datatypes
